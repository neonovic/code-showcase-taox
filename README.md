In this repo are a few picked files from an old legacy e-commerce project that I helped to slowly migrate to the Laravel framework.

The task on this project was maybe a little bit uncomfortable, but very common I think = "Write YAGNI/KISS as much as possible".
This cms/e-commerce legacy project was maintained/developed by an "un-skilled" staff. Written in PHP 5.4.
Many junior developers will be involved in this company in the future.

I decided to switch the whole project from PHP 5.4 to 7.4 and Laravel 8. And instead of VueJS or React I have choosen Livewire.

I have learnt so much in this legacy refactoring. Switching to Laravel was not easy - at first I developed my little own MVC framework as a middle step.
This was a perfect learning environment to learn Laravel a little bit deeper, because many things are still running from the legacy codes and I had to learn how to setup Laravel properly to deal with it.
